## Overview
 We, Over9000 Team are CS students from CSUEB: Hao Tu Lam, Yi-Nong Wei, Nischitha Chottanahalli Nagaraju and Margaret Hu. We started developing this app when we participated in CodePath-CSUEB Android Development Course. When the course ended, Hao Tu Lam and Yi-Nong Wei continue building more features for this app, and  Nischitha Chottanahalli Nagaraju becomes our team's representative. We're all young and passionate developers, and our team is excited and eager to promote our app and launch it in App Store. 

 PioneerAsk is an app that helps connect CSUEB students with CSUEB Pioneers Community. This app can also be a useful pocket guide for new students where you can get quick advice from the CSUEB community who are currently studying and working at CSUEB.
